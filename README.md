# Doit-Experiments

Various experimental Doit extensions. The rules:
* No stability promises. If you need a specific state of the repository, then clone a specific SHA1.
* No CPAN releases. Only git-cloning is supported. Once a module proves to be useful, it may be removed from this repository and go to CPAN.
* No separation of pod and code. However, if a module gets official, then the pod should be separated into an own file.
* Tests are nice, but not required.
